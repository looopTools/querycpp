# Querry C++ 

Querry C++ is a library for easy SQL query building for modern C++ for multiple SQL dialects. 

*NOTE:* This library is in no way production ready in its current state 

*NOTE:* Right now this library mainly servers as a way to get better at C++ and to build a nifty little tool for me
